# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Key Features

1. Real-Time News Updates: The app pulls live news data through a third-party API, ensuring that users receive the most up-to-date stories.
2. Categorized News: Users can filter news by different categories such as World News, Politics, Business, Technology, Entertainment, Sports, and more.
3. Search Functionality: A built-in search feature allows users to quickly find news articles based on keywords or topics of interest.
4. User-Friendly Interface: Designed with simplicity in mind, Breaking Now offers an intuitive interface that is easy to navigate, making it accessible for all users.
5. Responsive Design: The app is fully responsive, meaning it provides a smooth experience on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.
6. Bookmark and Save: Users can bookmark their favorite articles for easy access later.
7. Dark Mode Support: A dark mode feature for a comfortable reading experience in low-light environments.

## Technology Stack

1. Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (React.js for the UI).
2. Backend: Node.js (if applicable) or simply integrated with the third-party API for data fetching.
3. API: Integrated with News API (or any other third-party news service).
4. Hosting: Deployed on platforms like GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Vercel.

## How to use

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies: npm install
3. Set up your News API key (sign up for a free account at News API and place your key in the appropriate configuration file).
4. Run the application locally: npm start
5. Enjoy the latest breaking news!

## Contributing

We welcome contributions! If you have an idea for a new feature or bug fix, feel free to fork the repository and submit a pull request.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
